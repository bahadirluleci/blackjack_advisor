# Blackjack Game Documentation

## Overview
This project is a **console-based Blackjack game** implemented in Python. It assists players by providing suggestions for optimal moves during the game. The player competes against the dealer (computer) with the goal of reaching a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. The game includes features such as hand splitting, doubling down, and using strategies for different types of hands (pair, soft, and hard hands) to guide the player in making the best decisions.

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. The game deals two cards to both the player and the dealer.
3. The player can:
   - **Hit**: Draw another card.
   - **Stay**: End their turn.
   - **Double**: Double the bet and take only one more card (if eligible).
   - **Split**: If the first two cards are the same, split into two hands.
4. The dealer plays after the player.
5. The winner is determined based on the best hand value.

---
## Rules 
1. S17: Dealer stands on 17 or more.
2. Double: You can usually double on any 2 starting cards, although some tables permit only hands worth 9, 10 or 11
3. Split: You can split any 2 cards of the same value. Only 1 additional card on split Aces. A split Ace + 10 counts as 21, not Blackjack

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- User will be informed about the best move
